=== Laryngitis ===

I've lost my voice. There are things in my head but when I go to say them they just don't come out anymore, at least not the way they used to. The connection between mind and body is growing farther apart as the days pass. Like a couple that haven't seen each other in a long time, it will take some work. It won't be easy to start, but eventually they'll remember what it was like to be so close, they'll remember how it felt to have that strong connection, and they'll want it back.

My mind still loves my body, but my body's kind of sour after so long. My mind often goes for days without talking to my body, not because it doesn't want to, but because it often gets caught in its own thing. It has all these things going on, and all these things it wants to maintain, that it forgets about the thing that it thinks will always be there. It won't always be there, not if you don't treat it right.
